            Hi, I'm Jamal Salama! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
I’m a passionate full-stack developer with [X years] of experience building robust applications and scalable microservices. My expertise spans both the application and presentation layers, allowing me to deliver end-to-end solutions that are both functional and user-friendly.

I’ve had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies, including cloud platforms like IBM Cloud, where I’ve deployed and managed applications and microservices. I’m particularly skilled in leveraging IBM Watson Services, having worked extensively with tools like Watson Assistant, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Sentiment Analyzer to create intelligent, AI-driven solutions.

Whether it’s crafting seamless user experiences or solving complex backend challenges, I thrive on turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and innovative code. Let’s build something amazing together!
